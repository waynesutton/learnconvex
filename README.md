## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm or yarn package manager

### Installation & Development

1. **Clone and install dependencies:**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd convexcourse
   npm install
   ```

2. **Start development servers:**

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This runs both frontend (Vite) and backend (Convex) servers concurrently.

3. **Available Scripts:**
   - `npm run dev` - Start both frontend and backend servers
   - `npm run dev:frontend` - Start only the Vite frontend server
   - `npm run dev:backend` - Start only the Convex backend server
   - `npm run lint` - Run TypeScript and build checks

## App Architecture

### Frontend (`src/`)

The frontend is built with Vite and React, featuring a modern chat-style interface for the learning experience.

### Backend (`convex/`)

The backend uses Convex for real-time functionality, with the main course logic handling AI interactions and progress tracking.

## App Authentication

This app uses [Convex Auth](https://auth.convex.dev/) with Anonymous authentication for easy sign-in. You may wish to change this before deploying your app to production.

## Course Configuration

The app supports configurable course settings in `convex/course.ts`:

```typescript
const COURSE_SETTINGS = {
  "how-convex-works": {
    totalQuestions: 10, // Adjustable
    maxScore: 100,
  },
  "build-apps": {
    totalQuestions: 7, // Adjustable
    maxScore: 100,
  },
};
```

### Question Randomization

Each learning session generates a unique randomized question order to ensure varied learning experiences:

- **Structured Question Bank** (`convex/questions.ts`) - Predefined questions with answers, explanations, and topic tags
- **Session-Based Randomization** - Question order is randomized when a new session starts
- **Consistent Learning Path** - Each user follows their randomized order throughout their session
- **Course-Specific Questions** - Different question sets for conceptual vs. practical learning tracks

This approach maintains the integrity of the "learn Convex journey" while providing fresh experiences for returning users.

## Learning Analytics

The app includes a comprehensive statistics page at `/stats` that tracks:

- **Course Completion Metrics** - Total sessions started vs completed
- **Scoring Analytics** - Average scores across all courses and by mode
- **Learning Progress** - Questions answered, skipped, and estimated accuracy
- **Course Mode Breakdown** - Usage distribution between Chat Mode, Cards Mode, and How Convex Works
- **Recent Activity Feed** - Latest learning sessions with scores and progress
- **Score Distribution** - Visual representation of score ranges across all users

The stats page is publicly accessible and provides valuable insights into learning patterns and course effectiveness. Access it via the "Stats" link in the footer of any page.

## Developing and Deploying Your App

Check out the [Convex docs](https://docs.convex.dev/) for more information on how to develop with Convex.

- If you're new to Convex, the [Overview](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/) is a good place to start
- Check out the [Hosting and Deployment](https://docs.convex.dev/production/) docs for how to deploy your app
- Read the [Best Practices](https://docs.convex.dev/understanding/best-practices/) guide for tips on how to improve your app further

## HTTP API

User-defined HTTP routes are defined in the `convex/router.ts` file. We split these routes into a separate file from `convex/http.ts` to allow us to prevent the LLM from modifying the authentication routes.

## Contributing

This is a learning platform designed to teach Convex.dev concepts. Feel free to extend the courses, add new learning tracks, or improve the user experience.
