## Implementation Plan

The application uses a reactive architecture with Convex as the backend to provide real-time learning experiences. The AI assistant guides users through interactive courses with dynamic questioning and immediate feedback.

### Architecture

- **Frontend**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Backend**: Convex for reactive data and serverless functions
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI API for intelligent course instruction
- **State Management**: React hooks with Convex real-time queries
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with custom Convex design system

### Data Flow

1. User selects course type
2. Session created in Convex database
3. AI generates contextual questions and responses
4. Progress tracked in real-time
5. Completion triggers celebration and final score

### Relevant Files

- ✅ `src/App.tsx` - Main application component with course selection and chat interface
- ✅ `src/components/MessageRenderer.tsx` - Renders AI messages with syntax highlighting
- ✅ `convex/course.ts` - Backend functions for session and message management
- ✅ `convex/schema.ts` - Database schema for sessions and messages
- ✅ `package.json` - Dependencies including Convex, OpenAI, and UI libraries
- ✅ `tailwind.config.js` - Custom styling configuration
- ✅ `convex/` - Convex backend configuration and functions

### Technical Components

- **Session Management**: Unique session IDs for tracking individual learning journeys
- **Message System**: User and AI message storage with role-based rendering
- **Progress Tracking**: Question counts, scores, and completion status
- **AI Integration**: OpenAI GPT for generating educational content and responses
- **Real-time Updates**: Convex reactive queries for live UI updates
- **Celebration System**: Confetti animations and badge system for engagement

### Environment Configuration

- Convex deployment URL
- OpenAI API key for AI responses
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- React + Vite development environment
